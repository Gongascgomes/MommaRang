# MommaRang
Multidisciplinary project for the 2nd year of the video games course at Etic Algarve, platform 2D game  made in Unity/C#.

This project is a 2D platform game where the player controls a mother going after her child to beat him up as a tradicional portuguese mother would do!
In the game the mother has a flip flop witch she uses it as her weapon and just like thor's hammer or kratos axe, 
this powerfull weapon comes back to her like a boomerang in a way that she's able to fight all the person's that get her in the way of her son's punishment.
